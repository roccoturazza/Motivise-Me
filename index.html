        <h1>Motivational Speaker</h1>
        <p>If you asked me what the most valuable lesson in life is,
            I would say, "wasting time", wasting time in doing what you love.
            The only certainty we know of, is that time passes,
            the very same way that candles, eventually, burn out,
            how leaves fall in autumn and all good things come to an end.
            Enjoy it while it lasts, Efficency should never be a factor 
            when doing what you truly enjoy.</p>
        <p>My name is Rocco Turazza,
            I never had fatasys of becoming a motivational speaker as a child,
            the idea of speaking in public never particularly appealed to me,
            not to mention, confidence was never my strong suit.
            I hemorrhaged at the age of 8, Looking back on this, now,
            I can safely, without a shadow of a doubt, say, 
            that was the biggest hurdle I ever had to overcome. 
            Calling into question everything that I knew and all I dedicated
             my self to, until that point.</p>

        <h2>Artist</h2>
        <p>Hi, still, Rocco Turazza. A very gradual learning process naturally unfolded, for me, as I moved back home.
            I was nine when my dad put a paintbrush in my hand and said, "paint".
            What began as a way for me to explore and express my feelings and emotions, evolved into a new understanding and a fresh mindset 
            with which to takle this invisible barrier that layed in my way, it made all basic tasks like moving, talking, eating, walking infinately more 
            challenging, it really was unlike anything I had ever experienced.

        <h3>Graphic Designer</h3>
        <P>Rocco Turazza, again. I am a graphic designer. In a time were graphic design, really, is everywere.
            Having modern, creative and engaging ideas that stand out from the rest has proven to be, quite, crucial, as the whole 
            purpose of graphic design is to catch the attention of the viewer within seconds. 
            I love creativity in it's entirity, both physical and not, 
            My objective is to always create what is needed, no more, no less.
        </P>
